## Entry Strategies

### Adaptive (Recommended)

Intelligent entry based on current market price vs signal range:

- **Price above range**: Wait for pullback to range top
- **Price below range**: Enter immediately at market
- **Price in range**: Enter at current market price

### Midpoint

Simple entry at the middle of the signal range. Safe but may miss optimal entries.

### Range Break

Enter when price breaks into the signal range:

- **Buy signals**: Enter at range top
- **Sell signals**: Enter at range bottom

### Momentum

Aggressive entry at the start of the range for maximum profit potential.

## Signal Processing

The system automatically parses signals in this format:

```
EURUSD BUY RANGE: 1.0850 - 1.0880
SL: 1.0820
TP: 1.0920
```

Extracted data:

- **Symbol**: EURUSD
- **Direction**: BUY
- **Entry Range**: 1.0850 - 1.0880
- **Stop Loss**: 1.0820
- **Take Profit**: 1.0920
